Thanks for stopping by my website!
\n\n
I am a second-year master student of the Natural Langauge Processing Group, School of Computer Science and Technology, Fudan University ([https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpen/main.htm FudanNLP]). My advisors are pre-tenured assistant professor [https://guitaowufeng.github.io/ Tao Gui] and professor [http://www.qizhang.info/ Qi Zhang]. I'm interested in many of 
subtasks of NLP, such as Keyphrase Generation (ACL21), Named Entity Recognition (EMNLP20, IJCAI20) and Text Generation.
